# Experiencing Fubo

For this class we were introduced to Figma as a wireframe creation software. Some common features contained within the software include creating widgets and templates of items (to make them reuaseable) for easy construction of different views.

In other programs like Photoshop or Google Drawings, there is a pretty well defined way to select shapes or predefined items to place on the screen. From these experiences I have an built up an **expectation** on how this process should function, mainly where the buttons are located within the design of the interface. As seen below, there is a farily simple way to find a plethora of items to be used that can be customized after being placed in the drawing within Google Drawings.

However, this is not something that I could find very easily within Figma! Specifically, I couldn't easily figure out how to group the items into one resuable item and retrieve it. Below is a screenshot of the same area in the menus of Figma.

I am very familliar with Google Drive and all their neat functions, so a lot of my assumptions about the **affordances** of this layout have been learned from their implementation. Affordances can be described as the things we can *use* within a product; like how a chair's affordances include a place to sit. When I made the switch to Figma, there were many ways that my **mental model** - how I expected the system to operate - broke down upon entry. For example, they use a more "professional" style of creating objects to reuse. I assume this comes from the idea that their product is designed to have a robust interface and many many items contained within a specific file or product, so they need to have their systems fucntion in a different way than a product designed to only create a single picture. This discrepancy between my **mental model** the designers **conceptual model** - the actual reality of how the product functions - is a fairly common strife within the world of Usability Engineering.

I have since learned that to select preconstructed items into the design space, you must navigate to the Assets page in the top and find the item you are looking for. This is actually a fairly painless process, but I expected the assets page to only include items that I have personally added to the project.

This mismatch between my expectation of the product and it's actual function reduced my **efficiency** of the product, but did not actually remove any **satisfaction** from creating a finished product. I eneded up kind of fumbling around until I found a crude way to create shapes and text, where I just finished the assignment from there. This made the product still feel **effective** in my hands, even though I knew there was probably a little more power I could have extracted from the tools at hand.
